Introduction: The world torn asunder bellowed a gapping maw, devouring cities in masses, and the earth – scarred – laid the
testament of history.  

The Truth (Documentation #1): A spatial anomaly caused a catastrophic environmental change in the Earth’s atmosphere, distorting 
the laws established by Man and from the chaos, the nature of magic is introduce, an ever-changing source of energy. The effects of 
magic tore the world asunder and caused the death of millions with a sliver of Mankind, who took to the skies, survived the 
apocalypse. Centuries in darkness, pillars of light shine their glow upon the soil, displaying vegetation in abundance. Mankind 
returned to the healed Earth and took reign once more, locking away their secrets and forbidden the exploration or technological
advancement, forming an oath, deceiving the descendants of the truth. 

The Truth (Documentation #2): Eventually, their goal succeeded and the blind were lead in silence, for even the King, holder of
secrets, did not knew of the true history. We’re all marionettes to a nonexistent puppeteer.
