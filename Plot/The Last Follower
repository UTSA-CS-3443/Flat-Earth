The Last Follower, who has seen many parts of the world where only few have seen, spreads his tale to the far corners of the world, earning his friendship of Veritas and the company of the Lifebane King who enjoyed his stories, for his wife – the Queen – was very found of. In his stay, he would try to convince and inspire others of the tales of shimmering golden seas, verdant groves as far as the eye can see, etc. The Lifebane King of his tale, offers him aid to his venture to spread his ideals, however, the day before departure, his last venture ends as he drowns in the ocean’s abyss.
