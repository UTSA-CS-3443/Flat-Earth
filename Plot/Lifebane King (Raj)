The Lifebane King was a righteous, kind-hearted man, following the ancient laws of his forefathers, however, the toll weighing down
on him from the death of his wife and only son corroded him long before Bloodline Alchemist poisoned him. In his sadness, he sought
a target, Bloodline Alchemist, to answer for his deeds of failing to save his child, but his anger was not sated, as if the spirit 
of famine took hold, eventually destroying the Province of the Gods in matter of hours. The persecution of blasphemous individuals
or those desiring to venture the world soon found themselves sleeping eternally. Through his anger, followed sadness, and with 
sadness, closure. He sought the warmth of the Celestial Agent only to growing mad of the poisoned waters and in his moment of 
weakness, he too, poisoned the Celestial Agent.
